# Implementation Report: Elasticsearch and Redis Deployment with Ansible

## Project Overview
This report documents the implementation of Ansible playbooks for Elasticsearch and Redis services deployment, focusing on practical implementation decisions and best practices without over-engineering.

## Implementation Approach

### Best Practices Implementation
- Implemented essential best practices while maintaining simplicity
- Avoided over-engineering by focusing on necessary functionality
- Balanced between functionality and maintainability
- Used standardized directory structures and naming conventions

### Role Initialization
- Utilized `ansible-galaxy init` for role creation
  - Created standardized role structure for Elasticsearch
  - Created standardized role structure for Redis
- Retained complete directory structure for future extensibility
- Maintained unused directories for potential future requirements

### Infrastructure Access
- Established secure SSH connectivity
  - Added SSH key to target servers
  - Configured key-based authentication
  - Validated secure connection establishment

### Service Installation
- Followed official documentation for service installations:
  - Elasticsearch: Implemented according to Elastic's official guidelines
  - Redis: Followed Redis project's recommended installation steps
- Selected optimal installation methods based on:
  - Stability considerations
  - Maintenance requirements
  - Security implications

### Role Components (Sub-roles)
Utilized various Ansible role components:
1. Tasks
   - Main service installation steps
   - Configuration management
   - Service control operations

2. Handlers
   - Service restart management
   - Configuration reload operations
   - Error handling

3. Defaults
   - Default variable definitions
   - Basic configuration settings

4. Variables
   - Environment-specific settings
   - Custom configurations

5. Meta
   - Role dependency definitions
   - Role information

### Security Implementation
- Implemented Ansible Vault for secret management
  - Encrypted sensitive configuration data
  - Protected authentication credentials
  - Secured API keys and tokens

## Project Structure

### Main Directory Layout
```
ansible_project1/
+-- ansible.cfg         # Core Ansible configuration
+-- deploy.yml         # Primary deployment playbook
+-- inventory.ini      # Server inventory definitions
+-- secret.yml        # Vault-encrypted secrets
+-- test_elasticsearch.yml  # Elasticsearch testing
+-- test_redis.yml    # Redis testing
+-- roles/            # Service roles
```

### Role Structure
Each service role maintains the standard Ansible structure:
```
roles/[service]/
+-- defaults/    # Default configurations
+-- handlers/    # Event handlers
+-- meta/       # Role metadata
+-- tasks/      # Implementation logic
+-- tests/      # Testing scripts
+-- vars/       # Variable definitions
```

## Key File Analysis

### Configuration Files
1. ansible.cfg
   - Basic Ansible configurations
   - Connection settings
